# Caesar Cipher in Java

This is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm in Java. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet.

## How to Use

You can use this program to encrypt, decrypt, and brute force messages using the Caesar Cipher. The program interacts with the user through the console. You can either use the default text provided or provide your own custom text for encryption or decryption.

### Encryption

To encrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher, follow these steps:

1. Run the program in your Java development environment or from the command line.
2. Choose the encryption option.
3. Enter the text you want to encrypt or press Enter to use the default text.
4. Enter the shift value (an integer) by which you want to shift the letters in the plaintext.
5. The encrypted message will be saved to the `encoded.txt` file.

### Decryption

To decrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher, follow these steps:

1. Run the program in your Java development environment or from the command line.
2. Choose the decryption option.
3. Enter the encrypted text you want to decrypt or press Enter to use the default text.
4. Enter the shift value (an integer) by which the letters in the encrypted message were shifted.
5. The decrypted message will be saved to the `output.txt` file.

### Brute Force

To brute force a message encrypted using the Caesar Cipher, follow these steps:

1. Run the program in your Java development environment or from the command line.
2. Choose the brute force option.
3. Enter the encrypted text you want to brute force or press Enter to use the default text.
4. The decrypted messages will also be saved to the `output.txt` file.

## Getting Started

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Import the project into your Java development environment.
3. Build and compile the project.
4. Run the program.
5. Follow the instructions provided in the console to perform encryption, decryption, or brute force operations.
